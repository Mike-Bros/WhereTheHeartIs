## Overview

"Where The Heart Is" is a Python-based tool designed to aid prospective homebuyers in visualizing and calculating various mortgage scenarios. Originally built using Jupyter notebooks, the project has now transitioned to a Dash-based web application, offering a more user-friendly and interactive interface. This application allows users to input different mortgage conditions and visualize the implications of varying interest rates and loan terms on monthly payments.

  see immediate updates on monthly mortgage payments.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic plotting of mortgage payments across a range of interest rates, highlighting specific
  scenarios for deeper analysis.
- **Customization**: Easily adjustable parameters to match any specific home buying scenario or financial condition.
- **Responsive Output**: Real-time updates to calculations and visualizations as input parameters are adjusted.
- **Exportable Results**: Exports summary graphs and tables to SVG format for easy sharing and reference.
