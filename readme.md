## Overview

"Where The Heart Is" is a web tool designed to aid prospective homebuyers in visualizing and calculating various
mortgage scenarios. Originally built using Jupyter notebooks, the project has now transitioned to a laravel web
application, offering a more user-friendly and interactive interface. This application allows users to input different
mortgage conditions and visualize the implications of varying interest rates and loan terms on monthly payments.
