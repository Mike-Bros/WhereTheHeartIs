## Overview

"Where The Heart Is" is a Python-based tool designed to aid prospective homebuyers in visualizing and calculating
various mortgage scenarios. Built using Jupyter notebooks and a dedicated Python
script (`MortgagePaymentCalculator.py`), this application provides a user-friendly interface to input different mortgage
conditions and visualize the implications of different interest rates and loan terms on monthly payments.

It's possible that I will adjust the platform someday to have a more user-friendly interface, but for now, it's a simple
Jupyter notebook that can be run locally.

## Features

- **Interactive Sliders**: Adjust variables like home price, down payment percentage, loan term, and interest rates to
  see immediate updates on monthly mortgage payments.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic plotting of mortgage payments across a range of interest rates, highlighting specific
  scenarios for deeper analysis.
- **Customization**: Easily adjustable parameters to match any specific home buying scenario or financial condition.
- **Responsive Output**: Real-time updates to calculations and visualizations as input parameters are adjusted.
